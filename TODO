Fix:
- Pretty Printer. I think it's buggy. There is a branch where I'm most the way
  through solving it. Consider refactoring and adding test suite along the way.

Refactor:
- Parser Library:
  - Reorganize, document, and give better variable names to things.
- For core data structures (e.g., Iter), split out:
  - Public API (in tutorial style)
  - Test Suite
- Make `Monad` a super class of all of the monad effect classes (via Val)
- Replace all the template haskell stuff with Generics
- Fuzzing Library:
  - Rename `Shrinky` to `Shrink`

Improve:
- Work on Chunky

New Feature:
- Parser Library: 
  - allow for two categories of errors, "invalid token" error (as
    is not), and "validation error". Validation error should underline in red
    '^'s the piece of syntax that failed to validate, in addition to a message
    as to why.
  - when color is off, print red '^'s as '!'s. (Requires new feature in pretty
    printer that allows pretty printers to change their behavior for when color
    is turned off.)
  - combine `<parser>` and `<parser>WS` functionality into a single interface
    (likely some sort of typeclass)
- Substitution Library:
  - in SubstElem type, support delayed shifts in addition to delayed incrs.
    Right now the representation is `s ⇰ ℕ64`, which means "for each ⟨s,n⟩, do
    an increment substitution in scope s for number of variables n" This should
    really be `s ⇰ ℕ64 ⇰ ℕ64` which means "for each ⟨s,ρ,n⟩, do a shifted
    increment substitution in scope s for shift level ρ and number of variables
    n".
  - Support the ability for the user's expression type to embed SSubstElem (or
    SubstElem, and combined with the usual var type, provide a prism into
    SSubstElem). This would allow applying an increment substitution to an
    expression to lazily evaluate it, so you could do `canon $ incr 1 $ incr 1
    e` and it would only traverse the expression once to push through the
    increment logic.
  - Make substitution failure a proper error type with Doc error message that
    describes failure, rather than just an option
  - change printing and parsing of "x:0…x:4" to be "x:0…4"

Test Suite Needed:
- Parser Library
- Pretty Printer Library
