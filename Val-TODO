GSubst right now has both GVar/Metas subst and scoped subst.

Let's split it apart so that we have three separate actions:

- global variable substitution
- meta variable substitution
- scoped variable substitution

so SubstEnv right now has two actions, and after the change it will have four

make meta variable substitution not stick delayed substitutions onto meta
variables

make global and scoped variable substitutions *do* stick delayed substitutions onto meta variables

current state of things is that all substitutions always stick (because we recently changed it to do it that way)

you'll need to split appendGSubst into two or three versions (where most of the work will be)

you'll need to surface copies of `subst` and friends for each variant/action
